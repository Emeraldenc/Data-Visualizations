df <- read.csv("world-population.csv")
summary(df)
```

## Including Plots

```{r line chart, echo=TRUE}
# Create a basic stair steps plot 
plot(df$ï..Year, df$Population, type = "l",main = "R - Line Chart",col = "yellow")
```

```{r step chart, echo=TRUE}
# Create a basic stair steps plot 
plot(df$ï..Year, df$Population, type = "S",main = "R - Step Chart",col = "purple")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
